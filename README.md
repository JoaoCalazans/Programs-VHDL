# Programs-VHDL
[Metric - Dark Saturday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVn2UM8-sKI)

This repository contains a collection of VHDL Components and previous (mine and others) projects, based on both PCS3115 & PCS3225 disciplines contend.
Projects here follow a Unit Control + Data Flow organization, combining Components - just like real ones (muxes, flip-flops, registers, ALU, ...) - into different digital aplications. Always when possible i will try to make acessible a EDA Playground link to the correspondent project, with both Design and Testbench. If the testbench ain't somewhere in the Git, is because i didn't created it or 'cause it's only on EDA.

Any suggestions, claims, love/hate declarations and/or music recommendations can send me here: joao.calazans@usp.br

Repository still in development. He is still a child, take it easy on him.
